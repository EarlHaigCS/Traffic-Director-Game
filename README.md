##Introduction

Toronto, New York, London, Tokyo, Beijing, Paris…… These are what we now know as the largest metropolitan centers in the world. Yet, they were once only small cities, and at the very beginning, mere settlements.

The “Build Your City” game suite aims, as its name suggests, to provide a chance for the user to create a virtual city. The user can name his own city, and begin from humble origins as the mayor of a Settlement. By playing three mini-games related to urban life and construction, each with its own style and demand for skill, the user can increase the population of the city, advance through a hierarchy of city levels, watch as the city grows towards an awe-inspiring Metropolis, and eventually rejoice as the city expands into a powerful Galactic Supercenter.

Each of the three individual games is an opportunity to refine the user’s hand-eye coordination. Overall, the game suite is an excellent source of entertainment, and provides a sense of achievement as the user experiences the city’s growth.
##City Levels

As the population of the city increases, the city moves through ranks, each with a unique name. Initially hidden content is also unlocked as the user’s city reaches certain levels. Here is a summary of the different city levels:
